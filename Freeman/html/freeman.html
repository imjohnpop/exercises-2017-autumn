            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p class="green">With an authoritative voice and calm demeanor, this ever popular American actor has grown into one of the most
                respected figures in modern US cinema. Morgan was born on <em>June 1, 1937</em> in Memphis, Tennessee, to
                Mayme Edna (Revere), a teacher, and Morgan Porterfield Freeman, a barber. The young Freeman attended <strong>Los Angeles City College</strong>                before serving several years in the US Air Force as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959. His first dramatic
                arts exposure was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of the exuberant
                musical Hello, Dolly!.</p>
            <p class="green">Freeman first appeared on TV screens as several characters including "Easy Reader", "Mel Mounds" and "Count Dracula"
                on the Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) show The Electric Company (1971). He then moved
                into feature film with another children's adventure, Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow! (1971). Next, there
                was a small role in the thriller <span class="seen good">Blade (1973)</span>; then he played <span class="unseen">Casca in Julius Caesar (1979) and the title
                role in Coriolanus (1979)</span>. Regular work was coming in for the talented Freeman and he appeared in
                the prison dramas <span class="unseen">Attica (1980)</span> and <span class="unseen">Brubaker (1980)</span>,
                <span class="unseen">Eyewitness (1981)</span>, and portrayed the final 24 hours of slain Malcolm X in
                <span
                    class="unseen">Death of a Prophet (1981)</span>. For most of the 1980s, Freeman continued to contribute decent enough performances
                    in films that fluctuated in their quality. However, he really stood out, scoring an <a href="http://oscar.go.com/"
                        target="_blank">Oscar</a> nomination as a merciless hoodlum in <span class="unseen">Street Smart (1987)</span>                    and, then, he dazzled audiences and pulled a second <a href="http://oscar.go.com/" target="_blank">Oscar</a>                    nomination in the film version of <a class="unseen" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/driving_miss_daisy"
                        target="movies">Driving Miss Daisy</a> (1989) opposite <a class="unseen" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001788/">Jessica Tandy</a>.
                    The same year, Freeman teamed up with youthful Matthew Broderick and fiery Denzel Washington in the epic
                    Civil War drama <a class="unseen" href="pages/glory.html">Glory</a> (1989) about freed slaves being recruited
                    to form the first all-African American fighting brigade.</p>
